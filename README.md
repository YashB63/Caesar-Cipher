# Caesar-Cipher
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and earliest known substitution ciphers.

In the Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext (the original message) is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on. The shift wraps around the alphabet, so 'Z' would become 'A'. The number of positions to shift is called the "key" or "shift value".
